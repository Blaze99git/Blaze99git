## overview
Hello and welcome to my GitHub README! My name is [Utkarsh Upadhyay] and I am a soon-to-be Electrical Engineering graduate with a passion for web and game development. In this README, you will learn about my interests, skills, education, and experience, as well as my future plans and goals.
I am a self-taught web and game developer who is always eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Unity, and C#, and I am always looking for ways to improve my coding abilities.In the future, I plan to create a web app, portfolio, and an open-world game that resembles the immersive worlds found in games like Elder Scrolls and Witcher. I believe that these projects will help me to showcase my skills and make a positive impact on the world.

## My Interests
Web Development
I have always been fascinated by the world of web development. I love the idea of creating something that can be accessed by people all over the world, and I am constantly amazed by the power of the internet to connect people and ideas. I have been teaching myself web development for a while now, and I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with React and Node.js, and I am always looking to learn more.

Game Development
I have been a gamer for as long as I can remember, and I have always been interested in the process of creating games. I love the idea of being able to create an entire world and tell a story through gameplay. I have dabbled in game development in the past, and I am familiar with Unity and C#. I am excited to continue learning and exploring this field.

## My Future Plans
Web App
My first goal is to create a web app that showcases my skills as a web developer. I want to create something that is visually appealing and easy to use, and that provides value to users. I have a few ideas in mind, and I am excited to start working on them once I graduate.

Portfolio
I also plan to create a portfolio website that showcases my projects and skills. I believe that having a strong online presence is important for any developer, and I want to make sure that I have a professional and polished portfolio to share with potential employers and clients.

Open World Game
My ultimate goal is to create an open world game that resembles the immersive worlds found in games like Elder Scrolls and Witcher. I want to create a game that allows players to explore a vast and detailed world, interact with interesting characters, and make meaningful choices that impact the story. This is a big goal, and I know that it will take a lot of time and effort to achieve, but I am excited to start working on it and see where it takes me.

## My Education
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Techno India University]. Throughout my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer science, which I believe will be valuable in my future career as a web and game developer.

## My Experience
Although I am a fresher, I have been working on various web development projects in my spare time to hone my skills. I have created responsive websites, built custom WordPress themes, and worked with APIs to create dynamic web applications. I have also worked on small game projects, including a 2D platformer and a first-person shooter.

## My Hobbies
When I am not coding, I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy novels, playing video games, and practicing martial arts. I believe that these hobbies help me to stay creative and motivated, and give me a break from staring at a computer screen all day.
